1.Automate Form Filling Using Selenium (on Ubuntu)
Goal: Run a Python script that opens Chrome, fills a web form, and submits it.

Step 1: Install All Requirements (Terminal)
Run these 4 commands one by one. This is the most important step to prevent errors.

Update Ubuntu's package list:

Bash
sudo apt update
Install pip (the Python installer):

Bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
Install the chromedriver (the "remote control" for Chrome):

Bash
sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver
Install selenium (the Python library):

Bash
pip3 install selenium
(If you run these, you will not get the ModuleNotFoundError)

Open VScode

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

# Initialize Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Step 1: Open form page
driver.get("https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp")
driver.maximize_window()

# Step 2: Find input fields by ID
fname = driver.find_element(By.ID, "fname")
lname = driver.find_element(By.ID, "lname")

# Step 3: Clear and fill the form fields
fname.clear()
fname.send_keys("Alok")  # Use your name

lname.clear()
lname.send_keys("Sahoo") # Use your last name

# Step 4: Find and click Submit button
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//input[@type='submit']").click()

# Step 5: Wait and print the new URL
time.sleep(5)
print("Form submitted successfully!")
print("Redirected URL:", driver.current_url)

# Step 6: Close browser
driver.quit()

Step 3: Run Your Script (Terminal)
Make sure you are in the same folder as your selenium_form.py file.

Bash
python3 selenium_form.py
