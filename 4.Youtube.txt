1.Automate Form Filling Using Selenium (on Ubuntu)
Goal: Run a Python script that opens Chrome, fills a web form, and submits it.

Step 1: Install All Requirements (Terminal)
Run these 4 commands one by one. This is the most important step to prevent errors.

Update Ubuntu's package list:

Bash
sudo apt update
Install pip (the Python installer):

Bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
Install the chromedriver (the "remote control" for Chrome):

Bash
sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver
Install selenium (the Python library):

Bash
pip3 install selenium
(If you run these, you will not get the ModuleNotFoundError)

Open VScode

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

# Initialize Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Step 1: Open YouTube
driver.get("https://www.youtube.com")
driver.maximize_window()
print("Opened YouTube successfully.")
time.sleep(3) # Wait for the page to load

try:
    # Step 2: Find the search bar
    # YouTube's search bar has a 'name' attribute of 'search_query'
    search_box = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "search_query")

    # Step 3: Type in the search
    search_box.send_keys("DevOps tutorials")

    # Step 4: Press Enter
    search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

    print("Search submitted!")

    # Wait 10 seconds to see the results
    time.sleep(10) 

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

finally:
    # Step 5: Close browser
    driver.quit()

Step 3: Run Your Script (Terminal)
Make sure you are in the same folder as your Youtube.py file.

Bash
python3 Youtube.py
